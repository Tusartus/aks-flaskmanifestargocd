## What this does?
This repo along with https://github.com/Tusartus/k8sjenkins-pycode creates a Jenkins pipeline with GitOps to deploy code into a Kubernetes cluster. CI part is done via Jenkins and CD part via ArgoCD (GitOps). argocd, jenkinks, is deployed on aks cluster using ingress, helm, kubunetes fundamentals like: service, deployment, configMap, clusterissue, DNS zone, etc ....
domain name I used namecheap  to buy one, but godaddy on aws route service can be do the same.


Please refer to the https://github.com/Tusartus/aks-flaskmanifestargocd/README.md and see  on how to use  Jenkins CICD , docker, argocd , AKS azure kubernetes service
